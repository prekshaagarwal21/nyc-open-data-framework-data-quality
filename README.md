# nyc-open-data-framework-data-quality

This code draws from the Open Data Toronto: Data Quality Score (DQS) project. The DQS allows users to get an idea of how good the data quality is before they even see it and it gives the owners and publishers of data the ability to improve the quality of their data assets.
